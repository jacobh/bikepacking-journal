# Day 1 - Colac to Princetown

I took the first VLine train to Colac, which departed Southern Cross at 6:55am. after getting in to Colac, having some brekky and picking up some sandwiches at a cafe, I set off.

### 0 - 13km

The ride started with 13km on sealed, quiet, country roads. The speed limit was 80kmh but felt pretty safe due to minimal traffic. Good views back over to the north and west from the top of the hill at around the 10km mark.

### 13 - 17km

At this point I descended down a pretty gravel road to find a sign at the bottom "Private Property no through access". Luckily, I bumped into the farmer and his two kids on bicycles here and he gave me directions through his property to continue on my way. If doing this route again I'd reroute around this.

### 17 - 30km

Continued mostly downhill on wide, well maintained fire roads through bushland, stopped for some lunch.

### 30km - 49km

This section started by wound its way through a pine plantation, then opened up along a ridgeline, with bushland on the left and beautiful views out over plantations and farmland to the right

### 49km - 52km

Turned into the bushland and had a pretty quick descent down into a gully. Towards the bottom it got pretty muddy with thick, sticky, goopy mud. I didn't feel like stacking it so walked the bit at the bottom. A short climb up the other side popped me out in some pastoral land and at a sealed C road.

### 52 - 59km

A nice and fast descent down to Kennedy's Creek on the tarmac flinged all the mud off of my tyres. The road then turned to gravel and climbed back up at a reasonable grade.

### 59 - 70km

Turned left and followed along a ridge for a couple of k's, with great views off to the right, then had a fast and punchy gravel descent through bushland, the best of the ride so far. As the road started to mellow out I made a sharp right turn into the valley and started climbed out the other side.

Around this point the afternoon had turned to late afternoon, with it being rather dark under tree cover and stunning, warm light from the sun sitting low in the sky.

At the top of this climb the bushland turned to a ridge, the gravel to tarmac, with pastoral land on both sides, rolling downhill at a gentle gradient. A short-but-painful climb at the end put me near the top of Fords Rd.

### 70 - 76km

Descending down Fords Rd I had my first view of the ocean for the day. The road was undulating for the first km or two, and then had a short-but-sweet fast descent twisting down to a creek. for a few hundred metres the road was similarly steep climbing back out the other side, which then hit a T junction with the Great Ocean Rd.

### 76 - 80km

I sipped some water, set up my tail light, and prepared myself for the final TT stretch on the GOR to camp. It was mostly downhill with light traffic so wasn't quite as bad as I was fearing.

At this point the sun was very low in the sky, making for a beautiful coastal landscape. I cycled through the tiny township of Princetown (public toilets, a closed pub &amp; a backpackers), and then over a boardwalk to the Princetown Recreation Reserve, where I set up camp for the night.
