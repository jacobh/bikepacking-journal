# Day 1 - Colac to Princetown

<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/5336977772/embed/3ac9152f1d851c48490de81277112328837bac31'></iframe>


I took the first VLine train to Colac, which departed Southern Cross at 6:55am. after getting in to Colac, having some brekky and picking up some sandwiches at a cafe, I set off.

### 0 - 13km

The ride started with 13km on sealed, quiet, country roads. The speed limit was 80kmh but felt pretty safe due to minimal traffic. Good views back over to the north and west from the top of the hill at around the 10km mark.

### 13 - 17km

At this point I descended down a pretty gravel road to find a sign at the bottom "Private Property no through access". Luckily, I bumped into the farmer and his two kids on bicycles here and he gave me directions through his property to continue on my way. If doing this route again I'd reroute around this.

### 17 - 30km

Continued mostly downhill on wide, well maintained fire roads through bushland, stopped for some lunch.

### 30km - 49km

This section started by wound its way through a pine plantation, then opened up along a ridgeline, with bushland on the left and beautiful views out over plantations and farmland to the right

### 49km - 52km

Turned into the bushland and had a pretty quick descent down into a gully. Towards the bottom it got pretty muddy with thick, sticky, goopy mud. I didn't feel like stacking it so walked the bit at the bottom. A short climb up the other side popped me out in some pastoral land and at a sealed C road.

### 52 - 59km

A nice and fast descent down to Kennedy's Creek on the tarmac flinged all the mud off of my tyres. The road then turned to gravel and climbed back up at a reasonable grade.

### 59 - 70km

Turned left and followed along a ridge for a couple of k's, with great views off to the right, then had a fast and punchy gravel descent through bushland, the best of the ride so far. As the road started to mellow out I made a sharp right turn into the valley and started climbed out the other side.

Around this point the afternoon had turned to late afternoon, with it being rather dark under tree cover and stunning, warm light from the sun sitting low in the sky.

At the top of this climb the bushland turned to a ridge, the gravel to tarmac, with pastoral land on both sides, rolling downhill at a gentle gradient. A short-but-painful climb at the end put me near the top of Fords Rd.

### 70 - 76km

Descending down Fords Rd I had my first view of the ocean for the day. The road was undulating for the first km or two, and then had a short-but-sweet fast descent twisting down to a creek. for a few hundred metres the road was similarly steep climbing back out the other side, which then hit a T junction with the Great Ocean Rd.

### 76 - 80km

I sipped some water, set up my tail light, and prepared myself for the final TT stretch on the GOR to camp. It was mostly downhill with light traffic so wasn't quite as bad as I was fearing.

At this point the sun was very low in the sky, making for a beautiful coastal landscape. I cycled through the tiny township of Princetown (public toilets, a closed pub &amp; a backpackers), and then over a boardwalk to the Princetown Recreation Reserve, where I set up camp for the night.

# Day 2 - Princetown to Blanket Bay

<iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/5342919054/embed/1d10d7c25455fbc0a016de79fe307cf810a26408'></iframe>

I got up around 7am feeling pretty fresh and took care of my morning camp chores, cooked some brekky, charge my devices, filled my bottles and packed up camp.

I rolled out of the rec reserve around 10am and went to the end of the road towards the beach for a quick look, but decided against venturing into the deep sandy 4WD tracks.

### 0 - 30km Old Ocean Road & Gellibrand River Road

I made my way back out of Princetown and then onto the first leg of the day, Old Ocean Road. When planning the route I thought this would just be a little back-road connector, but it turned out to be a real highlight of the trip. The road snaked its way up along the side of the Gellibrand river in a coastal valley with steep hills on both sides.

After 14km the road crossed over the Great Ocean Road and continued up the Gellibrand. This section was more of a roller coaster with much of the road a roller coaster of short climbs and descents. The scenery shifted from coastal plains to a mix of rainforest ferns and farmland.

### 30 - 47km Lavers Hill - Cobden Road

After two hours of tracking along the Gellibrand I turned right, and started the ascent to Lavers Hill. After a couple of flat k's the road wound its way up to Lavers Hill at a gentle 3.7% average gradient. Initially the landscape was mostly pastoral, but as the elevation increased it morphed into a lush rainforest with tall trees and large ferns. Many creeks flowed under the road as it twisted through many gullies.

After climbing for a bit over an hour I popped out at Lavers Hill, a common cafe stop along the GOR. I fuelled up on a toastie, chips & a coke and filled up my bottles.

### 47 - 76km Colac - Lavers Hill Road, Wait-a-while Road, Aire Settlement Road & Old Ocean Road

From Lavers Hill I got rolling again along the mildly terrifying 100km/h limit Colac - Lavers Hill Road (which turned out to be fine). The road rolled its way up the ridge line, netting a further 120m of elevation.

Here I turned off to the right and descended down the twisting gravel Wait-a-while and Aire Settlement roads. Over 12km I dropped 500m through lush forest, averaging 28km/h. The descent was punctuated by a couple of short rises which served to stretch out the fun.

At the bottom of the descent there was a short and sharp climb back up to the GOR, which I travelled on for a few hundred metres before turning off again onto Old Ocean Road.

Old Ocean Road had a surface resembling yellow builders sand, which was rather slow-rolling which sapped a bit of the fun out of it. The landscape was nice with a mix of pastoral and rainforest. The road twisted down at a gentle gradient for 6km, again dropping me off at the GOR.

### 76 - 89km Sand Road & Horden Vale Road

At this point the sun was getting low in the sky. I went along the GOR for a few hundred metres and turned off to the left down Sand Road. Sand Road was reminiscent of Old Ocean Road near Princetown at the start of the day, with a landscape mixing together coastal and pastoral elements, surrounded by steep hills. for the first couple of kilometres the road was very badly corrugated, with it being difficult to find a smooth line over the surface. 5km in I reached the Aire River Campground, crossed over the bridge, and had a quick stop to put on some additional layers for the imminent evening.

On the other side of the river there was a short and steep climb up out of the campgrounds to the ridge line, where I turned right and rolled down a few hundred metres towards Pigs Back Track. Upon arrival I was frustratingly met with a "Private Property No Access" sign and had to plan a reroute.

Scrolling around on the map on my phone I realised just how limited the options around Cape Otway were, and that the only way to get to my planned campsite was to trek back up to the Great Ocean Road and go around to Lighthouse Road.

With that, I climbed back up to where I turned off, and continued straight along the sealed Horden Vale Road all the way back up to the GOR. Initially there were a few very steep descents down to a bridge over a creek, then a steep climb out from the creek before plunging back down to the GOR. During this climbing I was starting to feel low on energy and smashed a Snickers bar, which helped.

### 89 - 107km Great Ocean Road, Lighthouse Road & Blanket Bay Road

Once I was at the base of the GOR the sun had well and truly set and I spent a few minutes getting my lights and reflective gear dialled in for the climb up the GOR. It was only 3km, but rose 190m at an average gradient of 6.8%. This was one of the more challenging sections of the ride, but I kept my head down and tapped out the climbing in 23 minutes. I was expecting this to be scary but after dark traffic was very light and I only saw a handful of cars. With my bright lights and reflective gear I felt safer and more visible than I would've been during the day.

I was very relieved to get to the Lighthouse Road turnoff at the top, and stopped and had a breather and some water. From here, I wound my way back down the 190m of elevation I'd just gained at a decent pace with my helmet and bar lights at max brightness. Descending in the dark with good, bright lights is a pretty cool experience, video-game-esque with the tunnel of vision that you have in front of you.

Towards the end of Lighthouse Road, I took a left turn to Blanket Bay Road for the final section of the day. Back on the gravel, the road descended and then had a couple of short climbs  hovering around the 5% mark, which, with the amount of fatigue in my legs, were pretty punishing.

The final section of the day descended down the rough and rutted Blanket Bay Road to the campgrounds, starting off at a gentle gradient, then steadily ramping up, with the final 100m at a sketchy -13%.

Looking back, I have mixed feelings about this section, as Sand Road and the Aire River were real highlights of the day, but the trek from there back to the GOR was a real drag with a loaded bike.
